# Portfolio Website  
I'm a big fan of pixelated art as well as neon colours, so I tried to impart that onto my website to make it look unique!  

Link to the hosted version of the site: https://assignment-1-200342167.herokuapp.com/  

My code uses a few external resources:  

Moving Background Image(not code reference but an image I did not create): https://wallpaperaccess.com/lofi-gif  

~10-lines of this colour-changing background css code: https://codepen.io/P1N2O/pen/pyBNzX / Manuel Pinto(https://manuel.pinto.dev/)  

Grayscale theme, I think it's a modified version of a standard bootstrap css file, I used some code from the index.html file as well: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale
